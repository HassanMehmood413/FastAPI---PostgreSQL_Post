to start working with PostgreSQL , we gonna need some libraries 

1. Psycopg


OBJECT Relational MAPPER:
-- > No more SQL 
-- > Perform all operations through traditional python code

EXAMPLE:

# Basically , this is ORM in which we defined the table ourselves 

# class Post(Base):
#    __tablename__ = 'blogs'
#    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
#    title = Column(String)
#    content = Column(String)
#    author = Column(String)




python = "^3.12"
fastapi = {extras = ["standard"], version = "^0.115.6"}
uvicorn = "^0.34.0"
psycopg2-binary = "^2.9.10"
sqlalchemy = "^2.0.37"



to add hashing in the user signup and login , we gonna use the following libraries
1. pyjwt
2. passlib[bcrypt]
